# Ansible Overview

## Introduction

The Integration Automation System uses Ansible for configuration management and automation of:

- Network infrastructure (switches, routers)
- Virtual machine deployment and configuration
- Kubernetes cluster setup and management
- Application deployment validation

## Architecture

Our Ansible implementation follows a structured approach:

```plaintext
ansible/

├── inventory/

│ ├── hosts.yml

│ └── group_vars/

├── playbooks/

├── roles/

└── collections/
```

Key Components

### Inventory Management

- Dynamic inventory generation from project configurations
- Secure credential management using Ansible Vault
- Group-based organization for different device types

### Playbooks

Main playbooks handle:

- Infrastructure deployment
- Network configuration
- Application deployment
- Validation and testing

### Roles

Specialized roles for:

- K3s cluster setup
- Network device configuration
- VM provisioning
- Post-deployment validation

### Collections

Required collections:

- community.general
- community.kubernetes
- ansible.posix
- community.vmware

## Integration Points

- Works with ZTP for network device configuration
- Integrates with Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Configures K3s clusters for container orchestration
- Manages Flux CD for GitOps workflows
