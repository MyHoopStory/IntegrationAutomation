# Document Upload (Coming Soon)

This feature is currently under development and will be available in a future release.

## Planned Features

The document upload system will use AI-powered parsing to automatically extract information from uploaded documents and populate form fields.

### Supported Document Types (Planned)

- Network diagrams (.vsd, .pdf)
- Configuration spreadsheets (.xlsx, .csv)
- Project requirements documents (.doc, .docx, .pdf)
- Existing network configurations (.txt, .conf)

### Planned Workflow

1. Select or drag-and-drop files in the upload area
2. The system will:
   - Validate file types and sizes
   - Process documents using Ollama AI
   - Extract relevant information
   - Pre-populate form fields

### AI Processing

The system will use Ollama to:

- Identify network components
- Extract VLAN configurations
- Parse IP addressing schemes
- Detect server requirements

## Development Status

This feature is currently in the planning phase. The implementation will integrate with our existing project creation workflow:


# Creating a Project

The project creation interface allows you to define all aspects of a new network integration project.

## Project Information

The form is divided into several sections:

1. Basic Project Information
   - Project Name
   - Shipping Information
   - Contact Details

Stay tuned for updates as we develop this feature to streamline the document processing workflow
