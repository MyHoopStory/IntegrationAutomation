AWX
Using AWX in your project as an automation hub is a great approach for managing and monitoring Ansible playbooks through a web-based interface. Here’s a breakdown of how you can set this up to meet your needs:

1. Setting Up AWX and Integrating It into Your Web App
- Install AWX: Begin by installing AWX on a dedicated server or VM. Since AWX is the open-source upstream project for Red Hat’s Ansible Automation Platform, it provides a web-based UI for managing Ansible automation.
- Access Through API: AWX has a comprehensive REST API, allowing you to integrate it directly with your web app. Your web app can communicate with AWX’s API to trigger playbook runs, fetch job statuses, and monitor progress.
- User Permissions: In AWX, you can set permissions to control which users or teams can manage and execute playbooks, making it easier to delegate automation tasks securely within your organization.

2. Creating Projects for Customer Configurations
- Define Projects in AWX: In AWX, a "project" is a collection of playbooks sourced from a Git repository or stored in AWX’s internal SCM. Set up a dedicated repository (or multiple ones) where you’ll keep the playbooks that configure network devices, vCenter, VMs, and any other required infrastructure.
- Variable Management: Each project in AWX can have specific inventories and variables associated with it. You could create a separate YAML or JSON file in the inventory repository for each customer configuration. This file would contain all relevant variables such as IP addresses, VLANs, and other configuration details.
- Uploading Configurations: In your web app, create a form where users can upload or enter a customer’s configuration details. The app can then save this configuration to the appropriate location in the repository that AWX will reference as an inventory file.

3. Integrating AWX with Ansible Playbooks Using Custom Variables
- Inventory Groups for Customer Resources: Organize each customer’s devices (switches, VMs, PDUs, etc.) into inventory groups (e.g., switches, servers, etc.) in AWX. You can map each inventory group in AWX based on the configuration details provided by the user in the web app.
- Playbook Customization: Design your Ansible playbooks to pull variables from AWX inventories, allowing you to run playbooks that dynamically adjust based on the customer's specific requirements.
- Using Templates for Job Runs: In AWX, set up "job templates" for each significant configuration task (e.g., provisioning network devices, configuring VMs, deploying vCenter). These templates can reference different playbooks and be populated with customer-specific variables.

4. Running Playbooks and Monitoring Job Status in AWX
- Automate Job Triggers: Once the project is set up, you can use the AWX API to trigger job templates directly from your web app. For example, a user can click "Deploy Network" in the app, which will start the relevant playbook in AWX to configure the switches based on the uploaded inventory.
- Monitor Job Status: AWX provides detailed job status and logging, which can be queried through the API and displayed in your web app. This feature allows users to monitor automation progress, see detailed logs, and handle errors without leaving the web app.
- Notifications and Alerts: Configure AWX to send notifications or webhook calls back to your web app when jobs start, succeed, or fail. This feedback loop ensures your app can alert users or update the project status based on AWX job results.

5. Example Workflow in AWX Integration with Your Web App
- User Uploads Configuration: A user uploads the configuration details (e.g., network IPs, VLANs, device types) for a new customer in your web app.
- Web App Sends Configuration to AWX: The app creates or updates an AWX project with the new configuration details as an inventory file and updates variables for that project.
- Run Playbook via API: The app triggers a specific job template in AWX, such as "Configure Network Devices" or "Deploy vCenter."
- Track Progress and Status Updates: The app retrieves job statuses from AWX, allowing users to monitor the job’s progress and view any output or error logs.
- Finalize Configuration: After each playbook run, the web app can display the status as “Complete” or “Failed,” allowing the user to make any necessary adjustments.

6. Considerations for Scalability and Maintenance
- Version Control for Configurations: Store each customer’s configuration as a separate branch or folder in your source control. This practice ensures you can track changes, roll back if necessary, and maintain versioned configuration files.
- Backup and Restore: Regularly back up both the AWX database and any configuration repositories. This setup will allow easy recovery if needed and ensure your customer configurations are secure and accessible.
- Automate Inventory Sync: Schedule inventory synchronization in AWX for configurations in Git so that any updates in the configuration files are automatically reflected in AWX, keeping the configurations in sync.

##Summary
This setup enables you to use AWX as the central automation hub within your web app, allowing you to manage customer projects and deploy configurations dynamically. Integrating AWX’s API into your app gives you control over automation processes, making it easy to trigger, monitor, and report on job executions directly from the app interface. This approach streamlines deployments and ensures all customer configurations are properly tracked and applied.
