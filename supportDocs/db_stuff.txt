PostgreSQL
- Outside of k3s cluster
- Store warehouse data
- Managed via terraform/Ansible

MongoDB
- Inside k3s cluster
- Store integration project data
- Managed ansible/helm chart

Linked by project ID (SO#?)

Material is ordered and warehouse tracker is filled with all logistical information. Inventory can be found within SO or PO#. Integration project information is often provided later and can be submitted on the webapp and then linked to the warehouse tracker by project ID. Would need to find a way to aggregate multiple tracker lines, PO#s, SO#s, and integration project data into a single project.
